# Announcements!
## Repository Retirement
As of April 2022, we are officially retiring this repo along with the experimental efforts on these diagnostics tools. The repo will stay read-only so no more merges or releases will be done. 
Thank you all for your interest and your support for the past years!

## Transition of logstash-input-azureeventhub plugin
As of April 25th 2018, Microsoft has transitioned the code and ownership of the logstash-input-azureeventhub plugin to Elastic which will take this plugin to the next level and ensure long term success of this project. We'd like to thank all our users in the community for your interest and support of this project. For all future suggestions and contributions, please refer to the [Elastic github repo](https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-input-azure_event_hubs).
